# Tea-Cozy
Codecademy project - Tea Cozy

-----------------

My CSS styles are a really big mess, I know (now, I hate flexbox).

I was not able to do some things:

1. I do not know how to center horizontally all the boxes.
2. I do not know how to arrange the images of "Tea of the month" accordingly to the redlines.
3. I do not know how to put the "Locations" title above the address boxes (and center it).
4. And a dozen more problems that I even do not know that exist.

Thanks for reviewing the project!!
